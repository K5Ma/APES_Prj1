This is the first attempt to merge the parts of project prepared individually until now. The central structure of multiple threads and queues is prepared by Khalid AlAwadhi, while the independent functionality of Socket and I2C portions are developed by me. I am using the central structure, and inserting my code to fit in that structure properly.
