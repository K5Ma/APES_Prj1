This Folder contains codes developed specifically for testing I2C bus with sensors used in the project (TMP-102 and APDS-9301).

The very initial commit is containing codes that were developed using numerous online resources, and wtih the help of my colleague Raj Lavingia. This was done in order to ensure that the sensors, board, and i2c bus - all were functioning properly. 

The later commits have no dependency/replications of the previously mentioned code. Rather, it uses the same underlying concepts in a completely different approach to make the entire interface clean, reliable, easily understandable, and cutting off significant time in debugging. I claim ownership only for these codes.
